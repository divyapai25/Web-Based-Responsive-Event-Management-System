# Web-Based-Responsive-Event-Management-System
As part of my Final Year Bachelor's Project, we developed a Web Application for Tata Motors Ltd. It replaces the notice-board based display of events to be conducted. The different functionalities of the application are :-
1. Organizer login and sign up page
2. New organizer and event details to be entered
3. Display of events conducted - corporate as well as social
4. Image gallery and social media integration

It is developed using HTML and CSS for designing the website and JavaScript for front-end coding. MySQL database is used to manage data and PHP for back-end coding.
